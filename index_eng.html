<h1>The RUP method solution of Rubik's Cube</h1>
Author: Tsung-Yen Wu (吳宗諺)

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Here is a teaching website for the Rubik's Cube solution. The teaching method is a new method I created.
<p>
The first step of this method is to do a 2x2x3 block as well as the Petrus method, but all the rest steps is not the same as the Petrus method. There is also a difference of essence. The Petrus method still has to complete the first two layers, which is similar to the CFOP method. Now introduce this method is a group reducing method, reduced to the R, U face rotations group and the group that does not destroy completed pairs, no F2L, no PLL, OLL, and some steps have their own ideas.
<p>
So I give it a new name, "Reduce to R, U face rotations group and retain Pairs group", referred to as the "RUP method".

<h2>The Method</h2>

Step 1 is not difficult. The first and second steps in the <a href="http://lar5.com/cube" target="_blank">Petrus method</a> website are very detailed and will not be repeated here.
<ul>
<li>Step 1, complete a 2x2x3 block</li>
<li>Step 2, <a href="ru_eng.html">Reducing to R, U face rotations group</a>.</li>
<li>Step 3, <a href="2pairs_eng.html">Reducing to the group of retaining 2 pairs</a></li>
<li>Step 4, <a href="3pairs_eng.html">Reducing to the group of retaining 3 pairs</a></li>
<li>Step 5, <a href="4pairs_eng.html">Reducing to the group of retaining 4 pairs</a></li>
<li>Step 6, <a href="exblock_eng.html">Reducing to the group of retaining 3 pairs and 1 1x2x2 block</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>About Me</h2>
Tsung-Yen Wu (吳宗諺), now a mathematics teacher of a junior high school in Taiwan, has a very personality, does not like to talk, but loves to sing, loves math and music. He always thinks that mathematics is art. Music especially loves to listen to the blues and loves to listen to the singer's breathing.
